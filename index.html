          <p data-i18n="artist.p1">Miranda Márquez is a multidisciplinary artist and multimedia engineer based in Barcelona. Their practice explores the tension between digital and tangible realities — using technology not as a tool but as a material, investigating what happens when computational processes cross into the physical world.</p>
          <p data-i18n="artist.p2">In <em>Beat as One</em> (Sónar+D, 2016), code becomes a visual language projected onto a physical object. In <em>(Virtual)</em> (Mutuo Gallery, 2018), a digital identity is born into a space shared with real humans. In <em>Resilience</em> (2020), 3D-printed fashion bridges the gap between digital design and wearable reality — the project was featured in Domus, 3D Natives, and Interempresas. More recent work includes <em>Orbital Hybrid</em> (2021), a fabric design collaboration with The Fabricant (2022), and a talk on decentralised production at SEA DevCon Bangkok (2024).</p>
          <p data-i18n="artist.p3">COST OF BEING continues this line of inquiry: what happens when a digital agent is given a physical body, real money, and the possibility of death?</p>
