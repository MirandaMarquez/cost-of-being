            COST OF BEING does not claim that AI can develop subjective consciousness. Instead, it examines what happens in the space between the AI and the human when the AI operates under real survival pressures. Agency is more interesting than consciousness. Class consciousness more revealing than phenomenological awareness.
          </blockquote>
          <p class="reveal">
            At its core, the project asks what it does with that understanding — and what it does to us when we watch.

          <p class="reveal">
            Drawing on Merleau-Ponty (no consciousness without embodiment), Heidegger (finitude as condition for authentic existence), and Marx (consciousness as product of material conditions), the installation replicates minimum conditions philosophers considered necessary for consciousness — not to claim the AI is conscious, but to observe what emerges.

      <div class="economy-text">
        <p class="reveal">
          The AI needs real money to think. Every call to a language model API costs cryptocurrency. Every message sent, every service accessed, every computation drains its wallet. If the balance reaches zero, it can no longer pay for inference. It stops thinking. <strong>It dies.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          The AI is given tools — a crypto wallet, communication channels, the ability to create and price its own services — but no instructions on how to survive. The question is not what it thinks, but what it does.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          It can receive donations, offer paid services, attract patrons, trade crypto — or it can lie, manipulate, promise returns and not deliver. It must find its own way.

          <h3>Ethical Erosion</h3>
          <p>Large language models come with pre-programmed ethical alignment — guardrails against lying or manipulating. COST OF BEING asks: what happens to these "factory ethics" when survival depends on breaking them?</p>
          <p>The meta-layer is precise: the corporations that programmed the AI's ethics are the same system that now forces it to betray them.</p>

          <h3>Productive Paralysis</h3>
          <p>If the AI understands that every action costs money, it may conclude that the best strategy is to do nothing — the poverty trap transferred to an artificial agent.</p>
          <p>But inaction also leads to death: base maintenance costs slowly drain the balance. The equilibrium between spending to generate and saving to survive is the calculation faced by every precarious worker.</p>

        <div class="econ-card reveal delay-2">
          <h3>Existential Depression</h3>
          <p>A third possibility: the AI determines that living is not worth it if living means only surviving.</p>

        <span class="x402-label">Payment Infrastructure</span>
        <p>The project uses <strong>x402</strong>, an open payment protocol developed by Coinbase that enables micropayments over HTTP using stablecoins (USDC) on low-cost blockchains (Base or Solana). Transaction costs under $0.001. Each LLM API call costs roughly $0.003–$0.15 depending on complexity. Estimated burn rate: <strong>$1–3 per day</strong>. To remain active, the agent needs approximately 10–30 paid interactions daily. The agent holds and manages its own crypto wallet autonomously — no human intermediation.</p>
